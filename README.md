Josh Fishbein	Comp 20		Assignment 1

I have correctly implemented and completed all the specifications of this
assignment. I use two stylesheets for every html file (one for mobile and
one for other devices). These css files contain a number of rules (the total
number of rules is definitely more than 5). All html and css files pass the
w3c validators, producing no errors and only warnings. Frames, styling
elements in html, styling attributes in html, absolute URLs, front-end
frameworks, and javascript were not used in this assignment. All file
names use characters from the set [a-z0-9_.] and the three html files
created are named index.html, resume.html, and bio.html. This
assignment was created in the special repo called jfishb01.github.com.
I also committed to git on a frequent basis using meaningful commit
messages.

I discussed how to properly use GitHub with Scott Owades since I was
having difficulty pushing all my changes to GitHub. I also discussed
how to create the special repo with Ian Cross since I didn't fully
understand that component of the assignment.

It took me approximately 10 hours to complete this assignment.
