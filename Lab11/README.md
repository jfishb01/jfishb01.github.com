Josh Fishbein          Lab 11

This repo is for Ming Chow's Web Programming course (Spring 2013) 
at the Tufts University Department of Computer Science.

My favorite project for this course was Assignment 4 (the Frogger game)
because it was easy to see the results of my efforts and it was fun to test it
out and play the game. I could also show it to my friends and have them test it
out.

I am most proud of Assignment 3 (Where in the World?) because I thought it was
really need to interface with the google maps API and the MBTA API. I also feel
I had the best understanding of the material in this assignment and I thought
my submitted assignment was fully complete and implemented all components of
the assignment correctly.

I've learned a lot about web programming through this course. I really had no
understanding of what web programming entailed and I had no idea what tools
to use or how to interface with different APIs. I wish more time was spent,
however, teaching jQuery and I also wish PHP had been taught. I also wish
there was a little more instruction on how to use Heroku and MongoDB. I ran
into a large number of issues setting up these programs and wasted a lot of
time that I felt could have been saved had we been given a little more
instruction.
